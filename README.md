# Student-Registry-Simulator
This is a programming assignment that I received in my Computer Science II class. This assignment is a simple version of a student registry that works similar to how universities maintain a list of registered students in their system. It also includes a list of active courses that are currently running. This assignment greatly helped me increase and practice my knowledge on array lists, objects and classes, inheritance, and interfaces. I really enjoyed this assignment :)
